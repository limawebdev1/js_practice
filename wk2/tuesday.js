/*
    Given an array of Strings
    e.g. [ 'fwleif', '(249) 429-2913', '1235832817', '1k2if', '4jffa9ejg1', '149-294-1938', ... ]

    Write a function that returns an Array of only "valid" phone numbers (any 10 digit sequence is
    considered valid)

    e.g. 
    Given: e.g. [ 'fwleif', '(249) 429-2913', '1235832817', '2j3j1j4i2u4hu3huo1ji3il4', '4jffa9ejg1', '149-294-1938'],
    your function would return:

    [ '(249) 429-2913', '1235832817', '149-294-1938', '2j3j1j4i2u4hu3huo1ji3il4']

    Unconventional examples of "valid" phone numbers are: '2j3j1j4i2u4hu3huo1ji3il4' and '13924-19248'
    For the purposes of this challenge, these are also considered valid as long as there are ten
    digits in the String.

    Please provide me with at least 3 unique tests using console.log(questionablyValidPhoneNumber(arr)).
    Document your approach to the problem with comments.
